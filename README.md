# What is Server Software
This server software is a command line, menu-based program designed to make daily tasks with server work easy. The software achieves 
this by by automating daily tasks and simpliflying long common commands on debian-based systems into quick menu choices.

# Features
- View system and network information
- View logs (restarts, errors, kicks, and OS updates)
- Updating and restarting server
- Command line calculator
- Check CPU temperature
- Logging out

# Installation 
**Requirements**
To run this software you will need a debian-based Linux operating system with bash installed as the current shell (or backup).
This server was built initially on Rasbian (Raspberry Pi 4 & 0), but has been thouroughly tested on Ubuntu (Desktop and Server editions) 
and Debian. Next, it is required to have sudo privileges on the computer you wish to install this server on, otherwise several of the 
features listed above will not work. Lastly, it is recommended to also have gcc installed as the C compiler for the server if you wish 
to edit and recompile the program. 

**Running**
Running this software provided all of the necessary tools are installed is as simple as navigating to the directory this server
sofware is stored in and executing ./start

# Future Updates
**List of planned upcoming changes to Server Software**
- Add more menu options to automize even more daily tasks
- Add ability to change color scheme of the menu
- Design and add more efficient logging and analysis systems
